### Research question: 

-1. How is the trend of **malaria** change across the years in the WORLD ? 
-2. What is the 5 countries with highest death rates for malaria

-3. What is the preventive measures for malaria? 


### Brief explanation of Malaria: 

Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Anopheles mosquitoes, the main types of parasite that are found in infected population are Plasmodium
falciparum or Plasmodium vivax (@malariaintro). 

```{r worldtrend, echo = FALSE, preserve = TRUE, fig.cap ="Malaria world trend"}

malaria_data <- Data %>%
  select(Entity, Year, "Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)") %>%
  rename(Malaria = "Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)") %>%
  rename(Country = Entity) %>%
  filter(Year >= 2000) 

malaria_world<- malaria_data %>%
  filter(Country == "World") 

ggplot(malaria_world, aes( x = Year, y = Malaria)) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + ggtitle("Malaria world trend")

```


Figure \@ref(fig:worldtrend) shows the world trend of malaria death rate across 2000 to 2019. The downward trend could be the result of two reasons. Firstly, the increase in malaria program funding from 960 million US dollar in 2005 to 2.5 billion US dollar in 2014 (@MalariaTrend). Secondly, World Health Organisation (WHO) updated the strategies for malaria in 2010s, ensure it is efficient from time to time to control malaria transmission and increase in financial support for malaria researches in the early 2000s (@MalariaTrend2). 


```{r countries, echo = FALSE, preserve = TRUE, fig.cap = ""Top 5 Countries with highest Malaria death rate"}

malaria_mean <- malaria_data %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Malaria)) %>%
  mutate(Mean = ceiling(Mean)) %>%
  arrange(-Mean) %>%
   filter(!Country %in% c("Asia", "Africa", "African Region", "Central Asia", "Central Europe", "Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia",
                        "Central Latin America", "Central sub-Saharan Africa", "Commonwealth High Income", "Commonwealth Low Income", 
                        "Commonwealth Middle Income" , "East Asia","East Asia & Pacific - World Bank region", "Eastern Europe", 
                        "Eastern Mediterranean Region", "Eastern sub-Saharan Africa" ,"Europe & Central Asia - World Bank region", 
                        "European Region", "European Union" , "G20", "Low SDI", "High SDI", "Low-middle SDI",  "High-income", 
                        "High-income Asia Pacific", "High-income North America" , "High-middle SDI","Latin America & Caribbean - World Bank region" ,
                        "Middle SDI","Commonwealth", "African Union", "Southern sub-Saharan Africa", "Region of the Americas",
                        "South-East Asia Region" , "Southeast Asia","Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania", "South Asia - World Bank region",
                        "Sub-Saharan Africa - World Bank region" , "Western Europe", "Western Pacific Region" , "Western sub-Saharan Africa", 
                        "World" , "World Bank High Income", "World Bank Low Income","World Bank Lower Middle Income" ,
                        "World Bank Upper Middle Income"))

knitr::kable(head(malaria_mean, 5), caption = "Top 5 Countries with highest Malaria death rate")


```
Table \@ref(tab:countries) lists the top 5 countries with highest Malaria death rate. By comparing the mean death rate, the data of Nigeria is significantly higher than other countries. 


```{r countrygraph, echo = FALSE, preserve = TRUE, fig.cap ="Top 5 countries with the highest malaria death rate"}

malaria_top5 <- malaria_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Nigeria", "India", "Uganda", "Burkina Faso", "Democratic Republic of Congo")) 

ggplot(malaria_top5, aes( x = Year, y = Malaria, color = Country)) +
  geom_line()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  ggtitle("Top 5 countries with the highest malaria death rate")


```

Figure \@ref(fig:countrygraph) shows the death rate trend by countries from 2000 to 2019. Overall, the trend was decreasing over the years with fluctuations in some of the countries. The reason for the downward trend could be the increase in the population with access of insecticide-treated net in malaria prevalent countries from 7% to 67% in 2015 (@MalariaTrend).
